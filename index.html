        <h3>Why I Joined Alt School</h3>
        <p>I joined AltSchool Africa Academy to learn more about software development and get real practice in building useful applications. With my background in mathematics and experience as a data annotator, I wanted a clear learning path to help me move into the tech industry.
            Even though I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I needed proper guidance, hands-on projects, and mentors to help me improve. AltSchool provides all these, allowing me to learn the right way and connect with experts.
          I believe AltSchool will give me the skills and experience I need to succeed.</p>
